"""Youâ€™re building a system to grade multiple-choice quizzes. Each quiz has:
    A set of questions with fixed answers
    Each student submits answers to the quiz

You are given:
    correct_answers: a list of the correct options (e.g., ['A', 'C', 'B'])
    student_submissions: a list of student objects:
        student_id
        answers: a list of their selected answers

Rules:
    For each correct answer, the student gets +4 points
    For each wrong answer, -1 point
    No answer (represented by None) gets 0 points
    
Write a function that returns a dictionary mapping each student_id to their total score.


INPUT """
correct_answers = ['A', 'C', 'B', 'D']

    {"student_id": "S1", "answers": ['A', 'C', 'B', 'D']},  # all correct
